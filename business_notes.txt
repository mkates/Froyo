DirectTV:
Affiliate program on CJ.
Last updated special terms and service 2006.
Technically do not allow direct paid search but companies like whitefence.com work around this by creating another site
with a landing page that forwards them to whitefence.com. Also, we can negotiate better terms once we gain
some traction with them. $110 / activation

Dish:
Seems easy to get affiliate links through Saveology, $120-150 / activation based on performance.
